# INTEGRATIVE-BLOOD-CELL-ANALYSIS
Precise categorization of white blood cell (WBC) subtypes and measurement of cell counts from blood cell pictures are essential for identifying different medical disorders. Using the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we offer a unique method in this article to detect WBC kinds and estimate cell numbers from microscopic blood cell pictures. Our method makes use of a full CNN architecture, which has been trained on numerous datasets related to blood cell imaging. Using feature extraction and hierarchical learning, our model effectively distinguishes between several WBC types, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Furthermore, by analyzing cell morphology and spatial features, our method properly computes cell counts, facilitating a better understanding of the cellular composition of blood samples. Above the categorization and Regarding cell type quantification, our study is important. We compare the generated cell counts with established health markers to develop a prediction framework for assessing people's health states. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between aberrant cell counts and likely health hazards, underscoring the promise of our approach for early disease identification and surveillance. We are the first to use CNNs to estimate cell count, forecast WBC type, and assess health status simultaneously.
